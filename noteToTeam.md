**notes for the github repo
- use apps like github desktop or sourcetree to manage your branches. vscode also has an extension to push/pull from github if u prefer that. don't upload using the browser, it will take forever and rly gg if got conflicts ðŸ˜­

- please rmb to create your own branch, do not commit any code changes directly into main branch.
    - do work on the code and update your branch together, **please please please don't work on it elsewhere then upload to the branch. this way, you can more easily check if your code is ok within ur branch

- once your pull request is merged into the main, you can delete your current branch (or leave it, doesn't matter here). then create a new branch to fetch and update from there.
    - DO NOT work on the same branch after merging, this can cause weird conflict behaviours in the next merge!!!
    - on that note, try to merge frequently, try not to merge a huge chunk of features in each time

- always check with others for file name conflicts. For testing purposes, u can always just put ur name like loginTest_Chloe.java or create a test folder with your name first (chloeTestFolder)

- and most importantly, just ask if you're unsure!

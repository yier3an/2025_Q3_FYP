# IDEAS

## brain dump
- gamification of exercising
  - levelling up based on sessions/time/etc?
  - relating to tamagotchi, raising a pet -> other ideas? maybe collection of sth/RPG based
    - basically, what kind of rewards to hook the user into exercising more?

- what kind of information do they need to set it up?
  - preferably minimal set-up required, users can just sign up and go
  - can the user create their own workout routines with timers?

- reminders to exercise/take break
  - based on how much/little exercises logged
    - manual logs? auto after a timed-session?
  - may also include reminders of which exercises to not do multiple days in a row
    - eg. intensive exercise that shouldn't be done 2 days in a row, reminds user that they've done it alrdy the day before and shouldn't do it again today

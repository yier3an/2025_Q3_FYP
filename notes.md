# IDEAS

## brain dump
- gamification of exercising
  - levelling up based on sessions/time/etc?
  - relating to tamagotchi, raising a pet -> other ideas? maybe collection of sth/RPG based
    - basically, what kind of rewards to hook the user into exercising more?

- what kind of information do they need to set it up?
  - preferably minimal set-up required, users can just sign up and go
  - can the user create their own workout routines with timers?

- reminders to exercise/take break
  - based on how much/little exercises logged
    - manual logs? auto after a timed-session?
  - may also include reminders of which exercises to not do multiple days in a row
    - eg. intensive exercise that shouldn't be done 2 days in a row, reminds user that they've done it alrdy the day before and shouldn't do it again today
   
- Theme?
  - any storyline? or just a simple pet raising/collecting?
  - if there's a story, how do we make it "replayable" even after the user finishes it?
    - eg. typical RPG storyline, defeated the final boss (maybe it's the final goal of the user), how do we make it refreshing and not repetitive when the user starts a new goal?
    - endless mode? side quests? events(needs maintenance and upkeep)?
  - even without a story, how do we make it engaging enough for users to stay?
  - can the user turn off these quests to make it a simpler exercise tracking app?

## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a mobile application (for Android, iOS, or both) that can collect exercise 
data from cellphone sensors or wearable devices, provide training and fitness advice, and facilitate 
social interactions such as initiating competitions between registered users. The application should 
have the following features.

1. Collect exercise data:
  - The application can collect user exercise information from either the cellphone's own sensors or from 
smart wearable devices (via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.)
2. Estimate exercise effects (short-term or long-term) and provide analysis:
  - The application can estimate the exercise results of each activity, a day, a week, a month, or any 
period, such as the number of calories burned and the average and maximum heart rate.
3. Supply fitness advice and schedule a fitness plan:
  - The application can provide fitness advice according to the user's fitness goals and their entered 
health information. It can also create a fitness plan based on the fitness goal, and users can customize 
the plan to their preferences, such as the length of the plan or the daily weight loss goal.
4. Remind user of exercise or take a break:
  - The application can send reminders to users to exercise if they have not met their scheduled exercise 
goals. It can also send reminders to users to take a break if they have been exercising too much

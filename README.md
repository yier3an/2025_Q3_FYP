## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a mobile application (for Android, iOS, or both) that can collect exercise 
data from cellphone sensors or wearable devices, provide training and fitness advice, and facilitate 
social interactions such as initiating competitions between registered users. The application should 
have the following features.

1. Collect exercise data:
  - The application can collect user exercise information from either the cellphone's own sensors or from smart wearable devices (via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.)
2. Estimate exercise effects (short-term or long-term) and provide analysis:
  - The application can estimate the exercise results of each activity, a day, a week, a month, or any period, such as the number of calories burned and the average and maximum heart rate.
3. Supply fitness advice and schedule a fitness plan:
  - The application can provide fitness advice according to the user's fitness goals and their entered health information. It can also create a fitness plan based on the fitness goal, and users can customize the plan to their preferences, such as the length of the plan or the daily weight loss goal.
4. Remind user of exercise or take a break:
  - The application can send reminders to users to exercise if they have not met their scheduled exercise goals. It can also send reminders to users to take a break if they have been exercising too much

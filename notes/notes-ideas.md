# IDEAS

## brain dump
- gamification of exercising
  - levelling up based on sessions/time/etc?
  - relating to tamagotchi, raising a pet -> other ideas? maybe collection of sth/RPG based
    - basically, what kind of rewards to hook the user into exercising/use the app more?
	- when pet is raised, is there more pet options?
	  - randomised from a set of designs?
	  - how many pets can the user have at once?
	    - maybe like pokemon, multiple but choose to nurture 1 at a time

- what kind of information do they need to set it up?
  - preferably minimal set-up required, users can just sign up and go
  - can the user create their own workout routines?

- how to determine rewards?
  - time how long a user works out, give rewards based on intensity + time?

- what kind of rewards?
  - exp from exercise data + completion of certain tasks
  - complete set of tasks to get 

- reminders to exercise/take break
  - based on how much/little exercises logged
    - manual logs? auto after a timed-session?
  - may also include reminders of which exercises to not do multiple days in a row
    - eg. intensive exercise that shouldn't be done 2 days in a row, reminds user that they've done it alrdy the day before and shouldn't do it again today
  - can they schedule dates where they want to workout?
   
- Theme?
  - any storyline? or just a simple pet raising/collecting?
  - if there's a story, how do we make it "replayable" even after the user finishes it?
    - eg. typical RPG storyline, defeated the final boss (maybe it's the final goal of the user), how do we make it refreshing and not repetitive when the user starts a new goal?
    - endless mode? side quests? events(needs maintenance and upkeep)?
  - even without a story, how do we make it engaging enough for users to stay?
  - can the user turn off these "quests" to make it a simpler exercise tracking app?
